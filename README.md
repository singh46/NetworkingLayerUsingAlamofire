# NetworkingLayerUsingAlamofire
Easy to use networking layer using Alamofire in Swift

Good code to quick start networking integration in our new or existing swift code.

Using this small code we can easily integrate with multiple networking library or replace old networking library with new one without changing much code. 

Just create a new wrapper for new library connect it to route and thatâ€™s it.
